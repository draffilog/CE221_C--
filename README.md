Assumptions:
1. The data types for the private members of the Person class will be as follows: name (string), age (int), place of birth (string), password (string), balance (double), and transactions (vector of strings).
2. The .txt file will have each user's information on a new line in the following format: name,age,place of birth,password,balance,transaction1,transaction2,transaction3.
3. User authentication will be done by comparing the entered name and password with the ones stored in the .txt file.
4. All variables in the main will be dynamically allocated using the new keyword.
5. The iostream library will be used for input and output operations, and the using namespace std; directive will be used to avoid having to use the std:: prefix.
6. The code will be written in standard C++ and should be compatible with any Windows system with a C++ compiler.

Core classes, functions, methods:
1. Class Person: This class will represent a user in the banking system. It will have private members for the user's name, age, place of birth, password, balance, and transactions, and public methods for getting and setting these values.
2. Function authenticateUser: This function will take a name and password as input, and check if they match any user in the .txt file. If a match is found, it will return a Person object with the user's information.
3. Function registerUser: This function will take a Person object as input, and add the user's information to the .txt file.
4. Function makeTransaction: This function will take a Person object and a transaction string as input, and add the transaction to the user's list of transactions in the .txt file.
5. Function printUser: This function will take a Person object as input, and print the user's information (except password) and transactions.

Now, let's write the code for each file.
